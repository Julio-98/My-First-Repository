<p><strong>ABOUT SIF</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>SIF is the abbbreviation for <strong>Simple Followed Image</strong>, the name of a robot, which, as suggested, is capable of following a certain image with a few variation of collors, that can be chosen by a voice command. <img src="https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMgFYub9hHwAYoVaHn9aUGJAxe633zAB7TFD7DC" alt="SIF's picture"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THE SOFTWARE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>SIF was programmed using <strong>python</strong> as a programming language. And <em>her</em> Operating System is <strong>DietPi</strong>, a mini version of debian, chosen for its characteristic of being a lighter OS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THE HARDWARE</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>SIF can be described as the chassis of a tank, which carries a Raspaberry Pi 3, equipped with a WebCam, which works like her eyes. To control their engines, a Motor Driver was used. In order to work, the Raspberry is connected to a Battery Shield, powered by two lithium batteries and, its engines are powered by a bank with four batteries, also of lithium.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the moment, the robot project is not completed, and will be resumed soon at the end of the pandemic caused by the covid-19.<br>
However, the SIFâ€™s hardware was tested, it was controlled by a computer keyboard. And <em>her</em> software is also already developed and tested, using <em>her</em> operating system installed on a notebook.<br>
So, it is clear that the next step for the project is to wait for the end of the pandemic, and run the software tested on the SIF hardware. Thus, it will be possible to make the last adjustments.</p>
